# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Linear Regression, Random Forest & MLP

This project analyzes the **Wine Quality (White)** dataset to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.  
It was developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence module and includes exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **winequality-white.csv**, which includes variables such as:

- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Residual sugar  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (target variable)

## 🤖 Models Implemented

### **1. Linear Regression**
- Baseline model  
- Easy to interpret  
- Serves as a reference for more complex models  

### **2. Random Forest Regressor**
- Tree-based ensemble model  
- Captures non-linear relationships  
- Improves performance over linear regression  

### **3. MLP Regressor (Neural Network)**
- Multi-layer architecture  
- Learns complex patterns  
- Requires normalization and hyperparameter tuning

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)  
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- **R² Score**
